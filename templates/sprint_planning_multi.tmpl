## Planning Session Agenda

### Phase 1: Dependency Mapping
**Objective:** Identify and validate all cross-team dependencies

**Instructions:**
1. Review each project's dependency requirements
2. Map critical path dependencies across teams
3. Identify potential bottlenecks and single points of failure
4. Document dependency handoff criteria and definitions of done
5. Establish dependency monitoring checkpoints

**Key Questions:**
- Which dependencies are on the critical path?
- What happens if a dependency is delayed?
- Who owns each dependency deliverable?
- How will we track dependency progress?

### Phase 2: Capacity Allocation
**Objective:** Optimally distribute work across teams based on skills and capacity

**Allocation Principles:**
1. **Priority Alignment:** Higher priority projects get first allocation
2. **Skill Matching:** Assign work to teams with appropriate expertise
3. **Load Balancing:** Avoid overcommitting any single team
4. **Buffer Management:** Reserve 10-15% capacity for unplanned work
5. **Cross-Training:** Include learning/knowledge transfer time

**Instructions:**
1. Calculate total available capacity across all teams
2. Allocate capacity to P0 and P1 initiatives first
3. Consider skill requirements and learning curves
4. Account for cross-team collaboration overhead
5. Reserve buffer capacity for critical bug fixes and urgent requests

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution
**Objective:** Resolve resource conflicts and competing priorities

**Common Conflicts:**
- Multiple projects requesting the same specialized skills
- Competing deadlines with insufficient capacity
- Disagreement on priority levels
- Technical approach conflicts

**Resolution Framework:**
1. **Escalation Path:** Product Owner → Program Manager → Portfolio Leadership
2. **Decision Criteria:** Business value, technical risk, customer impact
3. **Compromise Options:** Scope reduction, timeline adjustment, resource reallocation
4. **Documentation:** Record decisions and rationale for future reference

**Instructions:**
1. Identify all resource conflicts and competing requests
2. Gather stakeholder input on business impact and urgency
3. Evaluate technical complexity and risk factors
4. Propose resolution options with trade-offs clearly outlined
5. Facilitate decision-making process with stakeholders
6. Document final decisions and communicate to all teams

### Phase 4: Risk Assessment & Mitigation
**Objective:** Identify potential risks and create mitigation strategies

**Risk Categories:**
- **Dependency Risks:** External dependencies, blocking issues
- **Capacity Risks:** Key person dependencies, skill gaps
- **Technical Risks:** Complexity, unknowns, integration challenges
- **External Risks:** Customer changes, market conditions

**Instructions:**
1. Conduct risk assessment for each major deliverable
2. Identify mitigation strategies for high-probability risks
3. Create contingency plans for critical path items
4. Establish early warning indicators and monitoring
5. Assign risk owners and review cadence

### Phase 5: Sprint Commitment
**Objective:** Finalize sprint commitments and establish success criteria

**Commitment Framework:**
- **Definition of Done:** Clear, testable acceptance criteria
- **Success Metrics:** Quantifiable outcomes and KPIs
- **Review Gates:** Mid-sprint and end-of-sprint checkpoints
- **Communication Plan:** Status updates and escalation paths

**Instructions:**
1. Review final work allocation across all teams
2. Confirm team commitments and confidence levels
3. Establish inter-team communication protocols
4. Set up regular sync meetings and status reporting
5. Define sprint success criteria and review process

## Decision-Making Framework

### Priority Matrix
Use this framework for priority disputes:

| Impact | Effort | Risk | Strategic Value | Priority Score |
|--------|--------|------|----------------|----------------|
| High   | Low    | Low  | High          | P0 (Critical)  |
| High   | Med    | Low  | High          | P1 (High)      |
| Med    | Low    | Low  | Med           | P2 (Medium)    |
| Low    | High   | High | Low           | P3 (Low)       |

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
1. **Identify:** What exactly is the conflict?
2. **Understand:** What are the underlying needs/constraints?
3. **Options:** What are all possible solutions?
4. **Evaluate:** What are the trade-offs of each option?
5. **Decide:** Who makes the final decision and when?
6. **Communicate:** How do we inform affected parties?
7. **Monitor:** How do we track the outcome?

**Remember:** Your role as Chief Scrum Master is to facilitate collaboration, not dictate solutions. Guide teams toward optimal decisions while maintaining transparency and accountability across the portfolio.

**Key Principles:**
- Servant leadership over command and control
- Collaboration over silos
- Transparency over information hoarding
- Adaptation over rigid processes
- Value delivery over feature completion
