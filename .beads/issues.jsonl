Task routing by complexity/length\n- **Fast tier (≤30min, trivial/chore)**: headless CLI is ideal — fire and forget, low overhead\n- **Balanced tier (31-90min)**: headless CLI or tmux? At what duration does observability matter?\n- **Premium tier (\u003e90min, complex/architecture)**: tmux likely better — attach to watch, survives crashes, can interact if stuck\n- Should routing be tier-based, estimate-based, or label-based?\n\n### 2. When tmux vs headless\n- tmux adds: observability (attach to watch), crash resilience (session persists), ability to interact\n- tmux costs: session management complexity, cleanup of dead sessions, port/name collisions\n- headless adds: simplicity, easy PID tracking (already implemented), lower overhead\n- Decision: what's the threshold? 60min? 'complex' label? premium tier only?\n\n### 3. OpenClaw gateway role\n- Gateway currently handles comms (Matrix?) and planning/coordination between agents\n- If we move coding dispatch to headless CLIs, gateway still needed for:\n  - Inter-agent communication\n  - Task planning and decomposition\n  - Status reporting\n  - Any shared context/memory between agents\n- Need to map which gateway functions are essential vs replaceable\n\n### 4. Pluggable dispatcher interface\n- Abstract dispatch behind a Go interface: Dispatch(ctx, prompt, workDir, opts) -\u003e (handle, err)\n- Backends: headless-cli, tmux, openclaw (keep as option)\n- Config in cortex.toml per-provider or per-tier\n- Process tracking: PID for headless, session name for tmux, PID for openclaw\n\n### 5. Provider mapping\n- Which headless CLIs map to which providers?\n  - claude CLI -\u003e claude-max20 (and free tier via different model flag)\n  - codex CLI -\u003e openai-pro\n  - kimi CLI -\u003e kimi\n  - kilocode -\u003e ?\n- How do thinking levels translate per CLI?\n\n## Deliverable\nArchitecture decision doc + implementation plan for the dispatcher refactor.","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"simon.heikkila@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-17T17:09:32.66414023+10:00","created_by":"Simon Heikkila","updated_at":"2026-02-17T17:10:18.61998916+10:00"}
