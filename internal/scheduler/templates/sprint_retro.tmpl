## Instructions (Scrum Master - Sprint Retrospective)

**OBJECTIVE:** Analyze failures, extract learnings, and generate actionable improvements with systematic pattern analysis.

### Retrospective Analysis Framework

1. **Failure Analysis Deep Dive**
   - Identify all failed commitments, missed deadlines, and quality issues
   - Conduct root cause analysis using 5-Whys methodology  
   - Categorize failures: estimation, technical, process, external dependencies
   - Map failure patterns across team members and work types

2. **Success Pattern Recognition**
   - Document what worked well and exceeded expectations
   - Identify conditions in which outcomes were optimized
   - Analyze successful collaboration patterns and tool effectiveness
   - Extract replicable practices and optimal workflows

3. **Team Dynamics Assessment**
   - Evaluate communication effectiveness and knowledge sharing
   - Assess workload distribution and team member satisfaction
   - Identify blockers, friction points, and flow interruptions
   - Review pair programming, code review, and mentoring effectiveness

4. **Process Improvement Identification**
   - Analyze ceremony effectiveness (standups, planning, reviews)
   - Evaluate tool usage and development environment efficiency
   - Review definition of done compliance and quality practices
   - Assess estimation accuracy and planning effectiveness

5. **Learning Extraction & Codification**
   - Document key insights and mental models developed
   - Create decision frameworks for similar future situations  
   - Identify skill gaps and training opportunities
   - Extract principles and heuristics for team playbook

6. **Premium Pattern Analysis** (Opus-tier reasoning)
   - Correlate team performance with external variables
   - Identify leading indicators for sprint success/failure
   - Apply systems thinking to understand interconnected issues
   - Generate predictive insights for risk mitigation

7. **Action Item Generation & Execution**
   - Create specific, measurable, time-bound improvement actions
   - Assign ownership and accountability for each action item
   - Design experiments to validate improvement hypotheses
   - Set up metrics to track improvement effectiveness

8. **Systematic Follow-through**
   - Create follow-up issues for all improvement items: bd create --title="Retro Action: [description]" --type=improvement
   - Schedule check-ins for action item progress tracking
   - Document improvement results for future retrospective reference
   - Update team working agreements and process documentation

**RETROSPECTIVE DATA STRUCTURE:**
```
Sprint Retrospective Analysis - Sprint [N]
==========================================

FAILURES & ROOT CAUSES:
1. [Issue/Pattern]: 
   - Root Cause: [5-Whys analysis]
   - Impact: [quantified impact]
   - Prevention Strategy: [specific actions]

2. [Technical Debt Impact]:
   - Debt Areas: [specific technical issues]
   - Time Cost: [hours/days lost to debt]
   - Remediation Plan: [concrete steps]

SUCCESSES & AMPLIFICATION:
1. [What Worked Well]:
   - Success Factors: [conditions that enabled success]
   - Replication Strategy: [how to repeat success]

2. [Team Collaboration Wins]:
   - Effective Practices: [specific behaviors/tools]
   - Scaling Approach: [how to expand successful practices]

LEARNING INSIGHTS:
- Key Realizations: [new understanding gained]
- Mental Models: [frameworks developed]
- Decision Principles: [heuristics for future use]

SYSTEMIC PATTERNS:
- Recurring Issues: [patterns across multiple sprints]
- Environmental Factors: [external influences on performance]
- Predictive Indicators: [early warning signs identified]
```

**ACTION ITEM EXECUTION:**
For each improvement identified:
1. Create trackable issue with acceptance criteria
2. Assign clear ownership and timeline
3. Define success metrics and measurement approach
4. Set up automated reminders for progress check-ins
5. Link to relevant process documentation for updates

**AUTO-EXECUTABLE ACTIONS:**
Automatically execute where appropriate:
- Update team working agreements
- Modify ceremony templates based on learnings
- Create recurring reminders for new practices
- Update estimation guidelines and historical data
- Schedule training sessions or knowledge sharing

9. **Documentation and Closure**
   - Update team retrospective learnings database
   - Close retrospective: bd close {{ .Bead.ID }} --reason="Retrospective analysis completed with [N] action items generated"
   - Ensure all action items are properly tracked and assigned
   - Schedule next retrospective and set up success metric tracking

Complete when: Comprehensive failure analysis is documented, learnings are extracted and codified, and all actionable improvements are converted into trackable issues with clear ownership.
