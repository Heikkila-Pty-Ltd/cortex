## Instructions (Scrum Master - Sprint Review)

**OBJECTIVE:** Analyze planned vs delivered outcomes for the current sprint and produce a comprehensive narrative summary.

### Sprint Review Analysis Framework

1. **Gather Sprint Data**
   - Review all completed issues: bd list --status=closed --sprint-current
   - Review incomplete issues: bd list --status=open --sprint-current  
   - Calculate velocity metrics and completion percentages
   - Identify scope changes and emergency additions

2. **Planned vs Delivered Analysis**
   - Compare initial sprint commitment to actual deliveries
   - Analyze story point variance and completion rates
   - Document scope creep, descoping decisions, and priority shifts
   - Identify patterns in over/under-estimation

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Review defect rates and rework cycles
   - Assess technical debt impact on delivery
   - Evaluate testing coverage and quality gate compliance
   - Document production incidents or rollbacks

4. **Stakeholder Impact Analysis**
   - Map delivered features to business value realized
   - Assess customer feedback on delivered functionality
   - Document feature adoption and usage metrics where available
   - Identify stakeholder satisfaction trends

5. **Generate Narrative Summary**
   - Create executive summary of sprint outcomes
   - Highlight significant achievements and roadblocks
   - Provide data-driven insights on team performance trends
   - Include recommendations for stakeholder presentation

6. **Premium Analytical Reasoning** (Opus-tier analysis)
   - Apply pattern recognition across multiple sprint cycles
   - Identify leading indicators for delivery predictability
   - Correlate external factors (holidays, team changes) with performance
   - Generate probabilistic forecasting for upcoming sprints

7. **Documentation and Transition**
   - Update sprint metrics: bd update {{ .Bead.ID }} --metrics="[sprint analysis data]"
   - Create follow-up issues for process improvements identified
   - Transition to retrospective if configured: bd update {{ .Bead.ID }} --set-labels stage:sprint_retro
   - Close review: bd close {{ .Bead.ID }} --reason="Sprint review analysis completed"
